# E-Commerce Platform CLOUD Architecture

![e-commerce cloud architecture diagram](image/architecture-diagram.jpg)


This architecture diagram is a scalable, secure, and highly available e-commerce platform built on AWS, leveraging Kubernetes (EKS), serverless functions, managed databases, caching, and modern cloud services. Below is a detailed breakdown of each component and data flow as depicted in the diagram.

---

## 1. Edge and Security

- **Cloudflare**
  - Acts as the initial entry point for all users.
  - Provides DDoS protection and general edge security.
  - Routes user traffic to AWS resources, primarily to the public website.

---

## 2. Content Delivery & Static Assets

- **Amazon CloudFront**
  - Serves static assets (HTML, JS, CSS, images) with low latency.
  - Connects to Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), which stores and delivers these static files.

---

## 3. Domain Entry Points

- **e-commerce.com**
  - Main customer-facing website.
  - Requests are routed through Cloudflare → CloudFront → S3/Other AWS services.
- **admin.e-commerce.com**
  - Admin portal.
  - Traffic flows through API Gateway and Elastic Load Balancer to an EC2 Auto Scaling group for backend admin services.

---

## 4. Core Application Layer

- **EKS Auto Scaling Group (Kubernetes)**
  - Hosts the main e-commerce application microservices and frontend.
  - **Frontend Site**
    - E-commerce web app container.
    - Affiliate marketing container.
    - Product management container.
  - **Service Containers**
    - Product, authentication, catalog, and checkout microservices.
  - These containers communicate internally and connect to other AWS services for data and caching.

---

## 5. Serverless Functions

- **AWS Lambda Functions**
  - Responsible for event-driven operations such as:
    - Payment Gateway
    - Inventory Tracking
    - Order Service
    - User Service
    - Affiliate Marketing
    - Tracking Service
  - Operate independently and can be triggered by application events or background jobs.

---

## 6. Admin Backend

- **EC2 Auto Scaling Group**
  - Handles admin-specific traffic (admin.e-commerce.com).
  - Protected by an Elastic Load Balancer and API Gateway for secure, scalable access.
  - Communicates with databases, cache, and background job processors.

---

## 7. Caching Layer

- **Amazon ElastiCache (Redis) Group**
  - Provides distributed caching for frequently accessed data.
  - Reduces load on the primary database and accelerates application performance.
  - Used by both EKS microservices and the admin backend.

---

## 8. Database Layer

- **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**
  - **Primary (Write) Node:** Handles all write operations.
  - **RDS Read Scaling Group:** Read replicas for scaling read operations, improving performance and high availability.

---

## 9. Background Job Processing

- **Amazon MQ**
  - Message broker for decoupling and scaling background job processing.
- **EC2 Instances**
  - Workers consume messages from Amazon MQ and perform asynchronous/background tasks (e.g., order processing, report generation).

---

## 10. Data Flow Summary

1. **Users** access the e-commerce website or admin portal via Cloudflare, which secures and directs traffic.
2. **Static content** is delivered from CloudFront/S3 for efficient loading.
3. **Dynamic requests** are handled by Kubernetes (EKS) microservices or the admin EC2 group, depending on the domain.
4. **Microservices** interact with the database (RDS), cache (ElastiCache), and use background processing for heavy or delayed tasks (via Amazon MQ).
5. **Lambda functions** enable event-driven operations, such as managing payments, tracking, and marketing.
6. **Scaling and High Availability** are achieved across all tiers via AWS-managed services: auto-scaling groups, EKS, RDS replicas, and distributed caching.

---

## 11. Key Benefits

- **Security:** Cloudflare DDoS protection, API Gateway, and AWS-managed security groups.
- **Performance:** Caching with ElastiCache, read scaling in RDS, and edge delivery via CloudFront.
- **Scalability:** Auto-scaling across compute, storage, and background processing.
- **Resilience:** Redundant architecture with multi-AZ databases and stateless containers.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Decoupled microservices, serverless functions, and background job processing.

_This design ensures the platform is robust, scalable, and ready for high-traffic e-commerce scenarios._
